# project-task-manager
#Project Objectives:
#Create a user friendly software to:
#Create Tasks such as, Events Meetings and Emails. 
#Software must be easy to use and understand.
#Include features that help the user, like History of deleted Tasks, and reuasble Tasks.
#Code must be easy to understand and must not be complex

**#Project Build:**
#Designing the structure of the classes 
#Designing how classes are connected (using is-a or has-a relations)
#Defining has-a and is-a relations and the use of object oriented programming in the context of the code
#Outlining important features such as history in the main method
#Ensuring that the code is coherent and that the classes are relevant and modular 
#Ensuring that the code will encompass all aspects of the task manager 
#Implementing the code and testing it using google test and a sample main

**#Running the project:**
#All input is through command line, and uses single digit inputs for choice making
#Begin by selecting whether to create a task or exit
#Select a subtype of class to instantiate 
#Input data to create the object of the class 
#The object is stored in a sorted linked list (time is sorted)
#Any edits needed to be done can be done on the menu 
#For example: deleting an object which will be sotred in a stack and then retrieved when needed (when option is selected)
#This loops infinitely until the user decides to exit the code (by inputting 0 into the command line)
